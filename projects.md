# Research Projects

## [RIGMS Testbed]

*Real-time Intelligent Garbage Monitering System (RIGMS) Testbed for IoT Cybersecurity.*

1. Responsible for the establishment and improvement of the Real-time Intelligent Garbage Monitoring System (RIGMS) Testbed for IoT cybersecurity research;

2. Master basic machine learning algorithms, further explore the design of IoT cybersecurity algorithms, and apply machine learning approaches to prevent IoT multiple-mix-attacks;

3. Until to now, have obtained a series of experimental data, and carried out corresponding data preprocessing, preliminary result analysis, and algorithm evaluation;

4. Still under working that will be finalized in Dec. 2022, and expect to submit to Rivest, Shamir and Adleman (RSA) Conference 2023.

The working paper can be found [Here](https://caihanlin.com/mypaper/202210camb.pdf) (Update in 30th Oct. 2022)

**Index Termsâ€”IoT Cybersecurity, Multiple-mix-attacks, Learning Based Detection**



## [Garbage Manager]

*Intelligent garbage management system for urban communities: [Garbage Manager].*

1. Took charge of the software and hardware interface part of the IoT Monitoring System, thousands of lines of high-quality and efficient code writing, and the technical documentation preparation of this system;
2. Grasped the comprehensive knowledge of IoT systems and learned how to connect software with hardware and how to use cloud computing to process IoT-generated data, etc.;
3. Penned a paper named An IoT Garbage Monitoring System for Effective Garbage Management and will report on this project as a presenter at IEEE CENIM in November 2022.

Accepted by International Conference on Computer Engineering, Network and Intelligent Multimedia ([CENIM]). The final manuscript can be found [Here](https://caihanlin.com/mypaper/202208cenim.pdf) (Update in 30th Oct. 2022).

**Index Termsâ€”IoT, Garbage Management, Data Visualization**
