## [Garbage Manager]

**Intelligent garbage management system for urban communities: Garbage Manager**

Abstractâ€”Nowadays, with the increasing output of municipal waste, the pressure on municipal waste treatment is increasing. In this case, utilizing low-cost and low-power IoT technology to improve urban waste management has become a popular trend. This paper proposes an intelligent garbage management system for urban communities: Garbage Manager. The Garbage Manager aspires to create energy-efficient and real-time waste detection based on IoT and data visualization technology. In this work, the NodeMCU chip integrated with a high-precision ultrasonic sensor is used to measure the height of the waste in the garbage bin and transmits the data to the database through the Ali-cloud IoT platform. In addition, a web page is created as a graphical user interface to display the status of the garbage bins in real-time. Experimental results show that the Garbage Manager is able to decrease the manpower from clearing the garbage by 24.07 % and reduce the garbage overflow times by 83.33 %.

## [RIGMS Testbed]

**Real-time Intelligent Garbage Monitering System (RIGMS) Testbed for IoT Cybersecurity**

Abstractâ€”This paper proposes a real-time intelligent garbage monitoring system (RIGMS) testbed for IoT cybersecurity research. The testbed is established by realistic devices in the physical world, which is a stage in the process of municipal waste disposal. Multiple-mix-attacks were conducted based on the testbed. During the attack scenarios, the network activities were analyzed, and the traffic features were extracted to design a representative RIGMS dataset for training and verifying the authenticity of the machine learning based models. In this paper, five advanced ML models were utilized to detect the cyber-attacks. Experiment results verified the feasibility of implementing learning based models to detect multiple-mix-attacks.
