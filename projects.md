# Research Projects

## [RIGMS Testbed]

*Real-time Intelligent Garbage Monitering System (RIGMS) Testbed for IoT Cybersecurity.*

1. Responsible for the establishment and improvement of the Real-time Intelligent Garbage Monitoring System (RIGMS) Testbed for IoT cybersecurity research;

2. Master basic machine learning algorithms, further explore the design of IoT cybersecurity algorithms, and apply machine learning approaches to prevent IoT multiple-mix-attacks;

3. Until to now, have obtained a series of experimental data, and carried out corresponding data preprocessing, preliminary result analysis, and algorithm evaluation;

4. Still under working that will be finalized in Dec. 2022, and expect to submit to Rivest, Shamir and Adleman (RSA) Conference 2023.

# Working Project

## [Deep ResNet for TSDS]

*Deep Residual Neural Network for Efficient Traffic Sign Detection System*

1. This paper has proposed a deep residual neural network (RNN) model for traffic signs detection system (TSDS) research. Experiments are conducted to verify the feasibility of implement RNN model for traffic sign detection and recognition;
2. Moreover, a new systematic analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method for model performance evaluation have been suggested, which is sufficient for deployment in the practical performance measurement of deep learning model.
