There must be **something truly magical** about standing on stage to give [a fantastic speech], which considerably lifts my spirits and energizes my entire body. If you desire to master a specific knowledge in deep, just give a prelection. 🧑🏻‍🏫 If you can explain to others for complete understanding, you are already an expert. I really enjoy the accomplishment of passing on my knowledge to others, so what I strive for is to be **a student's favorite lecturer** at the **[best universities in my hometown]**. 🏫

Swimming removes my worries, refreshes my body, and brings me courage to address any challenges. I extremely enjoy the feeling of being immersed in the water. 🏊 Besides, I am a member of the Swimming Team at Fuzhou University, where I meet many sincere friends. I have reached **China National Second-level athlete Standard** in 50m breaststroke and won **Five Gold Medals🏅️** during my swimming career. Recently, I am also keen on surfing. 🏄

## Past Hobbies

I previously enjoyed long-distance running, vlog making, and computer game developing/playing. However, I have not had time to do any of these things recently.
