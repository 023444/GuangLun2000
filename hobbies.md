I extremely enjoy the feeling of being immersed in the water. Swimming takes away my worries, refreshes my body, and brings me courage to address any difficulties. Besides, I am a member of the Swimming Team at Fuzhou University, where I met many good friends during college. I have reached **China National Second-level athlete Standard** in 50m breaststroke and won **Five Gold Medals** during my swimming career. Recently, I am also keen on surfing.

## Previous Hobbies

I previously enjoyed making vlogs, playing basketball and developing/playing computer games. However, I have not had time to do any of these things recently.
