# About Me

<img src="https://www.caihanlin.com/caihanlin.jpg" class="floatpic" width="360" height="480">

Hi ðŸ‘‹ My name is **Hanlin Cai (è”¡æ±‰éœ–)**. Here is [my latest CV](https://caihanlin.com/file/CV-HanlinCAI.pdf).

I am a junior majoring in Automation at [Fuzhou University](https://www.fzu.edu.cn/ ) (China) and Robotics and Intelligent Devices at [Maynooth University](https://maynoothuniversity.ie/) (Ireland, Combined Degrees). Recently, I have been nominated for the 2021-2022 **China National Scholarship (top 1%)**.

## Research Interests

Currently, I am interested in **IoT (Internet of Things)** and **ML (Machine Learning)**. The paper focusing on the IoT real-time intelligent garbage monitoring system with the aid of my supervisor ([Chin-Hong Wong](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Chin-Hong-Wong)) has been ACCEPTED by 2022 IEEE CENIM. Besides, I am currently attending a summer research project organized by the University of Cambridge under the guidance of [Prof. Pietro Lio'](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pl219/ ) to design an ML-based testbed for IoT **Cybersecurity** research.
