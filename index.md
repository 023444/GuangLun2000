您好👋 這裡是蔡漢霖的學術主頁。

My name is **Hanlin Cai**. I am a junior majoring in Automation at [Fuzhou University] (China) and Robotics and Intelligent Devices at [Maynooth University] (Ireland, Combined Degrees). I gain a CGPA of 3.79/4.00, ranking top 10% in my major. Recently, I am nominated for the 2021-2022 **China National Scholarship** (top 1%). 🎊

Currently, I am interested in **IoT (Internet of Things)** and **ML (Machine Learning)**. Also, the IEEE conference paper focusing on the IoT in smart cities in [CENIM 2022] with the aid of my supervisor ([Chin-Hong Wong]) will be published in Oct. 2022. Besides, I am currently attending a summer research project organized by the [University of Cambridge (CCISTC)] under the guidance of [Prof. Pietro Lio'] and exploring an ML-based scheme for IoT security. 🚀
